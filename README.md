## Kubernetes KMS Plugin

### Introduction

This project is an extension of the Kubernetes KMSv2 feature, which aims to enable encryption-at-rest using a KMS plugin. The main motivation is to integrate a physical random generator into the on-premise server create a HSM-like system for more secure encryption.

In my design, the KMS plugin will communicate with an on-premise server via REST APIs. The key encryption keys (KEKs) are generated by running a script on the on-premise server, and then saved in the on-premise server. Only the ciphertext/ plaintext is returned to the plugin via REST APIs.

Code for the on-premise-server can be found at https://github.com/kaijun123/kms-on-premise-server. The on-premise-server must be running before running the plugin.

### Environment
- M1 Mac (arm64)
- Docker Desktop 4.9.0 
- Kubernetes v1.27

### Directory
- ```pkg/scripts```: 
  - Contains yaml files for configuration and 2 shell scripts to simplify the configuration process. 
  - The scripts will be run in the control-panel shell, after the directory is mounted
- ```pkg/plugins/plugin.go```: Entrance of the repo

### Explanation of KMS v2beta1
- Refer to [KMS.md](pkg/scripts/KMS.md) for a full explanation

### Areas for improvement/ Future works
- Instead of making the manual changes to the encryption config file and deploying a new plugin when rotating keys, it is possible to do scheduled key rotation on the remote KMS alone. 
- This can be done by creating a script/ cli tool for the remote KMS server to generate a new KEK. The ```Status``` rpc response will change to notify the apiserver of the new KEK. ```keyId``` in the plugin will be updated. The old encryption key will be stored in the remote server. 
- New encryptions will involve the new KEK. But existing decryptions will be decrypted with the old KEK
- Right now, the annotation field is just a hardcoded value. However, it can instead contain information about the time of encryption. Hence when the ```Decryption``` rpc method is called, the remote server is able to identity the correct KEK to use.
